{"rule":"NUT_NOT","sentence":"^\\QWe see that the bending stiffness and the increase in string tension due to fretting sharpen the pitch, but that we can reduce these effects with a positive saddle setback and negative nut setback.\\E$"}
{"rule":"MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US","sentence":"^\\QWe then separated the contributions to the frequency deviations from ideal values caused by fretting by expressing these differences using the definition of logarithmic “cents” given by cents_def, resulting in the analytically exact expression for nonideal frequency shifts This approach has allowed us to determine Taylor series approximations to each of these contributions that are valid when the height of a string above each fret is small compared to the scale length.\\E$"}
