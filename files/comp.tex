 \section{Classical Guitar Compensation\label{sct:comp}}


\red{Strategy: Use $\Delta S$ to compensate for bending stiffness, and $\Delta N$ to compensate for tension increases arising from fretting. Doing so predicts that $\Delta S \approx 3$~mm for the Alhambra 8P with light-tension strings, or about twice the saddle setback that is actually manufactured.}
